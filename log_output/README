# Log Output Application

This is a simple Python application that continuously outputs timestamped log messages with a unique identifier. The application generates a random UUID at startup and then prints it along with an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp every 5 seconds.

## What the Application Does

The main application (`app.py`) performs the following operations[1]:
- Generates a random UUID string when the application starts
- Enters an infinite loop that:
  - Gets the current UTC timestamp
  - Formats it as ISO 8601 with milliseconds (e.g., `2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z`)
  - Prints the timestamp followed by the UUID
  - Waits 5 seconds before repeating

This creates a continuous stream of timestamped log entries, making it useful for testing log aggregation systems, monitoring setups, or demonstrating containerized applications.

## Using the Makefile

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile that automates the entire development workflow using Docker and Kubernetes (via k3d). 

### **Recommended Steps**

```bash
# Complete setup: build image, create cluster, and deploy
make rebuild

# Enable detailed debug output
make rebuild DEBUG_ENABLED=true

# View application logs in real-time
make logs

# Clean up all resources (pod, cluster, docker image)
make clean

# View all available commands
make help
```
